        January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet.
        Prior to this, the various computer networks did not have a standard way
        to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was
        established called Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol
        (TCP/IP). This allowed different kinds of computers on different
        networks to "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network
        officially changed to the TCP/IP standard on January 1, 1983, hence the
        birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a
        universal language.
